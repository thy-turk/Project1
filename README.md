### PROJECT 1 (Colorado Ski & Board Report)

### About
The Colorado Ski & Board Report© will provide a longtime Colorado resident, a recent transplant, or and adventurous visitor the opportunity for quick, informative, and detailed information based on their favorite Colorado Ski Resort and the quickest route to get there via the Google Maps JavaScript API. 

To authenticate input validation, we’re utilizing the Google Map’s Auto Populate API, and requiring a users email to subscribe to our weekly Newsletter.

The ‘Open Weather Map API’, provides current weather conditions, as well as ‘On The Snow’ widgets to provide a resorts snapshot (# of Open Lifts/Runs, Snow Depth, and Fresh Snow, as well as a link for detailed resort information:

We’ve also implemented ‘chart.js’, a new technology that provides a 3-day temperature forecast that is displayed in a line graph for a quick snapshot of the upcoming weather for each resort.


### Objective
1. Use at least two APIs.
2. Use AJAX to pull data.
3. Use at least one new library or technology that we haven’t discussed. Create a polished front end/UI .
4. Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.). Do NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals).
5. Incorporate some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc.).
6. Use Bootstrap or an alternative CSS framework.
7. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages.
8. Include user input validation.

## Problems Faced
* A big problem we had was finding suitable apis that were free and and also not protected by licensing. We eventually had to compromise and get our data through other apis and input methods.
